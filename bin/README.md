# MyMath .EX1


In our project we have the next classes:

Monom:  that can Calculate the actions plus, minus, multipy, divide and f(x). equal bettween 2 monoms.

Plynom: Collection of monoms.  also we have function call root- Intermediate value theorem and function call area- calcuate the area bettween the function and the positive area.

complexFunction  : the contain Monoms and polynoms Calculate the actions plus, mul,divide, min, max and comp -f(g(x)).

Function_GUI: Collection of function- drow the function in coordinate system. read, and print funnction from files and to graph and files.
